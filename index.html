		<p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code you use to style your webpage. CSS basics takes you through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make my text black or red? How do I make my content show up in such-and-such a place on the screen? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>

		<p id="parts">Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>

        <ul>
        	<li>Each rule set (apart from the selector) must be wrapped in curly braces ({}).</li>
			<li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its values.</li>
			<li>Within each rule set, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
		</ul>
